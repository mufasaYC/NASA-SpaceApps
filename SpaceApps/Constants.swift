var facts = [["Now this is seriously weird! A year in Mercury is 88 days, yet a day on Mercury is 176 Earth days." ,"Do you think you would be heavier or lighter on Mercury? Take a guess. Well, you’d actually be lighter, there is hardly any gravity on Mercury. If you weighed 32kg on Earth, you would only weigh about 12kg on Mercury!","Did you know? Mercury is the ONLY planet that doesn’t rotate exactly once a year."],["Wow this is pretty cool! If you had to somehow find a way to live on Venus, unlikely as it is, you’ll notice something really strange about the days. Venus rotates so slowly it’s like a snail, and a day on Venus is like 100 Earth days! No way, that would mean one seriously long school year. ","Venus also rotates in the opposite direction as almost all the other planets. So instead of the sun rising in the east and setting in the west, the sun on Venus rises in the west and sets in the east. How weird is that?"],["Earth is seriously old! about 4.65 billion years old. But, life on our planet has only existed for about 150 million. So life has only been around for about 5% to 10% of the time since Earth has been around! Whoa.","Earth has decided she needs a rest and is slowing down. Every few years and extra second is added to make up for the lost time. Millions of years ago, a day on Earth would have been 20 hours long, and it is thought that in millions of years, a day on Earth will be 27 hours long."],["Want to lose a bit of weight, well head off the Mars! If you weight 32kg on Earth you’d only weigh 12kg on Mars! That’s less than half, wow!","This planet has a seriously long year! It is 687 days long, almost twice as long as a year on Earth. Whoa, that would mean more school days!","Mars is home to absolutely massive volcanoes. Olympos Mons is the largest volcano in the solar system and stands nice and tall at 21km and is 600km wide at the bottom. That’s one serious volcano!"],["Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar system. It is so massive that more than 1,300 Earths could fit inside it. No way, that is absolutely humongous.","The average temperature in the cloud tops of planet Jupiter is -148⁰C. Wow that’s seriously cold. As you go deeper it then gets seriously hot!","Jupiter takes 9 hours and 55 minutes to spin on its axis. So this means that a day on Jupiter is less than 10 hours long.","Jupiter has loads and loads of storms raging on the surface, obviously with that famous Red Spot, which is actually the largest hurricane in our Solar System. It's been storming around for over three hundred years."],["Saturn is very light. This is because it’s made up of more hydrogen than helium so it’s less solid. If you could fit Saturn into a bathtub it would float, but how in the world would we find a bathtub that big? Perhaps start building one and enter the Guinness World Records!","Titan, the largest of the moons is the second largest in the solar system, after Ganymede, Jupiter’s moon. Titan is larger than Earth! It is also the only moon in the Solar system which has an atmosphere. The atmosphere is made up of nitrogen and methane.","This is awesome. Sometimes the rings of Saturn just disappear. This is because of the tilt of Saturn and the fact that some of the rings are quite thin. Every 14 years, the rings look like they’ve just gone!"],["Uranus spins lying on its side, just like a barrel. How weird is that as no other planets do that. Scientists think that maybe it was because of a big collision when it started forming, but no one knows for sure!","Whoa this is quite something. Uranus takes 84 Earth years to go around the sun, which means that each of its poles is in daylight for 42 years and in darkness for the next 42 years. Imagine living in darkness for 42 years or even in daylight for 42 years? That would be crazy.","Uranus has 27 moons. But the cool thing is that most of them are names after characters in Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream. The five major ones are Titania, Oberon, Miranda, Ariel and Umbriel."],["Neptune is the third largest planet in the Solar System, but is much smaller than the real giants, Jupiter and Saturn. It’s just a little bit bigger than Uranus.","Neptune has rings, wow! There are six of them which circle the planet, and it is believed that they are fairly new.","It takes Neptune 165 Earth years to orbit the Sun. That’s quite a lot of Earth years don’t you think?"]]

It is so because in 1876, the city was painted with terracotta pink colour in grand welcome of the Prince of Wales. Since then the name has not only stuck, but has given the city a unique identity.","Between 1727 and 1734, Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur constructed five astronomical observatories or Jantar Mantars. These structures with their amazing combinations of geometric forms at large scale have captivated artists, historians and architects.
